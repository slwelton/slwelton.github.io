<i>Sarah Welton is a Canadian freelance writer and photographer for hire. Having started out in technical writing at various software companies, she now is taking the writing skills she's honed from years of schooling and hobby-writing, and applying them to blogs and other professional writing needs.</i>



With that out of the way, my name is Sarah Welton and I am a graduate from the English Rhetoric, Media and Professional Communication program at the University of Waterloo. I graduated in June of 2019 with my Honours Bachelor's of Arts, with distinction, and a minor in Management Studies.

I've started teaching myself some basic programming because I feel like it's a valuable skill. This website is my first major project and demonstration of what I've learned so far.

I've spent the months since graduating working as the sole Technical Documentation Specialist at RDM/Deluxe Corporation, handling all of their technical documentation needs. I volunteer regularly in the KW tech community with HackerNestKW, and in between all of the busy-ness going on in my every day, I'm trying to find the time to finish a horror novel.

Send me an email or reach out on social media if you have any questions, want to chat a business opportunity, or just want to learn more!

You can find many examples of my work on this site, and on my social media profiles.
