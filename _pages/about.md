Welcome to my portfolio site. I hope you find what you're looking for! 

For a little more about me: 

I'm a skilled content leader who shapes user experiences through language. I do it creatively, I do it strategically, and the result is always compelling narratives that engage users, whether it's product copy or technical writing. I care about turning the complex into the simple, and creating the kind of user experience that users don't even have to think twice about.

I've been perfecting my writing skills for years, learning how to keep the user at the center of all that I do.

I've worked as a lone writer and in teams as small as 9 writers to a team of almost 70. 

# Tools and Skills

I know my way around: 

* Figma
* Git
* Markup languages including DITA, XML, Markdown, and AsciiDoc
* Site generators, including Antora and Jekyll 
* JIRA
* The Adobe Creative Suite
* User and website analytics tools like Google Analytics and Pendo
* Best practices for SEO 
  
It's easy to dive into code, and I have experience with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. 

I know the basics of programming and constructing websites - at least enough to get myself into trouble! 

I know how to create impactful instructional videos, and killer technical documentation. I love a good style guide and playing around with Vale to ensure automated writer compliance. 

I even have a great of understanding of Agile ceremonies and practices is supposed to work. 

# Work Experience

In less than 2 years after starting as a Senior Technical Writer at Couchbase, I was promoted to Principal Technical Writer and the first Content Design Lead at the company. 

I've implemented style guides for our documentation, UX copy, and our new Pendo content. I've written UI copy for several of our new features, jumping in with the UX designers to craft better and better user experiences - resulting in positive user feedback and happier stakeholders during feature review sessions. I'm helping to overhaul the entire information and content architecture of our documentation website, focusing on the user experience - I already overhauled all of the documentation for one of our services ahead of a major feature launch. 

For more details about past work experience, feel free to check out my LinkedIn. My tenure includes time at Unity Technologies, Deluxe, and a smaller startup. 

I firmly believe that I can help change the way users interact with and experience products through each word they encounter along the way - whether they notice it or not! 

I initially started this website as a coding demonstration, for showing off the web development skills I learned from some basic HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS courses. It's grown over time as I've learned more and figured out how to customize and elevate what I had. Currently, this website is based off of a Jekyll theme and is the home for my writing samples, photography, and contact information.
