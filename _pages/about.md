<i>Sarah Welton is a Canadian freelance writer and photographer for hire. Having started out in technical writing at various software companies, she now is taking the writing skills she's honed from years of schooling and hobby-writing, and applying them to blogs and other professional writing needs.</i>



With that out of the way, my name is Sarah Welton and I am a graduate from the English Rhetoric, Media and Professional Communication program at the University of Waterloo. I graduated in June of 2019 with my Honours Bachelor's of Arts, with distinction, and a minor in Management Studies.

Since graduation, I've been working as the sole Technical Documentation Specialist at RDM/Deluxe Corporation, handling all of their technical documentation needs. I volunteer regularly in the KW tech community with HackerNestKW, and in between all of the busy-ness going on in my every day, I'm trying to find the time to finish a horror novel.

I initially started this website as a coding demonstration, for showing off the web development skills I learned from some basic HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS courses. Now, this website is based off of a Jekyll theme, with some tweaks, and is the home for all of my writing samples, photography, and contact information. 

Send me an email or reach out on social media if you have any questions, want to chat about a business opportunity, or just want to learn more!
