<i>Sarah Welton is a Canadian technical writer, freelance writer, and photographer for hire. Having started out in technical writing at various software companies, such as SAP, OpenText, Dematic Logistics and Deluxe, she is now applying the writing skills she's honed from years of schooling and hobby-writing, and applying them to blogs, technical writing for software and hardware, and other professional writing needs.</i>



With that out of the way, my name is Sarah Welton and I am a graduate from the English Rhetoric, Media and Professional Communication program at the University of Waterloo. I graduated in June of 2019 with my Honours Bachelor's of Arts, with distinction, and a minor in Management Studies.

Immediately following my graduation, I was working as the sole Technical Documentation Specialist at RDM/Deluxe Corporation, handling all of their technical documentation needs for their SaaS offering. Most of my technical documentation experience has been with SaaS offerings, and I've had the chance to document various APIs for a more technical audience, while also covering the "how-to" for end users.

I volunteer regularly in the KW tech community with HackerNestKW, and in between all of the busy-ness going on in my every day, I'm trying to find the time to finish a horror novel.

I initially started this website as a coding demonstration, for showing off the web development skills I learned from some basic HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS courses. Now, this website is based off of a Jekyll theme, with some of my own personal tweaks added in, and is the home for all of my writing samples, photography, and contact information.
