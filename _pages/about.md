Welcome to my portfolio site. I hope you find what you're looking for. 

I'm a technically-minded technical writer with a knack for developmental editing and content architecture. I've been working as a technical writer for going on 4 years, and quickly made my way up to being a senior practitioner. 

I've worked as a lone writer and in teams as small as nine writers to a team of almost 70. 

I know my way around AsciiDoc, Markdown, and multiple out-of-the-box CMSs. I know Git, have a great of understanding of how Agile is supposed to work, and love playing around with Vale. 

I believe that UX is just as important in the documentation as it is inside the product, and strive to write the best documentation for the end user and their unique goals. 

I initially started this website as a coding demonstration, for showing off the web development skills I learned from some basic HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS courses. It's grown over time as I've learned more and figured out how to customize and elevate what I had. Currently, this website is based off of a Jekyll theme and is the home for my writing samples, photography, and contact information.

Send me an email or reach out on social media if you have any questions, want to chat about a business opportunity, or just want to learn more!
