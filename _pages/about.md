Welcome to my portfolio site. I hope you find what you're looking for! 

# What You Need to Know

I'm a technically-minded content professional who translates "experienced developer" into "explain this to me like I'm five". I love getting hands-on with developer tools and reading source code - if I'm writing about it, I want to make sure that it's accurate.

I've received repeated praise throughout my career for being able to translate tough technical concepts into simple, clear explanations. 

I fell in love with the craft of technical writing from my first co-op/internship while I was completing my undergrad. I love the challenge of trying to write while meeting all the constraints that come with technical writing: audience needs, style guides, and time. 

I've worked as a lone writer and in teams as small as 9 writers to a team of almost 70. 

# Tools and Skills

I know my way around: 

* Git
* Markup languages including DITA, XML, Markdown, and AsciiDoc
* JavaScript, specifically React and Node
* A bit of Python 
* Static site generators, including Antora and Jekyll 
* The Diataxis documentation framework
* MadCap Flare and Oxygen XML editor
* JIRA and Confluence
* Vale, from setup to configuration and maintaining styles
* The Adobe Creative Suite
* Figma 
* User and website analytics tools like Google Analytics and Pendo
* Creating style guides
* Best practices for SEO 
* Pendo, from Guides to configuring user analytics

I also know how to create impactful instructional videos using tools like Camtasia and Audacity. 

# Work Experience

In less than 2 years after starting as a Senior Technical Writer at Couchbase, I was promoted to Principal Technical Writer. 

I've implemented style guides for our documentation, UX copy, and our new Pendo content. I've written UI copy for several of our new features, jumping in with the UX designers to craft better and better user experiences - resulting in positive user feedback and happier stakeholders during feature review sessions. I'm helping to overhaul the entire information and content architecture of our documentation website, focusing on the user experience - I already overhauled all of the documentation for one of our services ahead of a major feature launch. 

For more details about past work experience, feel free to check out my LinkedIn. My tenure includes time at Unity Technologies, Deluxe, and a smaller delivery startup. 

I initially started this website as a coding demonstration, for showing off the web development skills I learned from some basic HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS courses. It's grown over time as I've learned more and figured out how to customize and elevate what I had. Currently, this website is based off of a Jekyll theme and is the home for my writing samples and contact information.
