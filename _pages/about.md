Welcome to my portfolio site. I hope you find what you're looking for. 

I'm a skilled content leader who shapes user experiences through language. I do it creatively, I do it strategically, and the result is always compelling narratives that engage users, whether it's product copy or technical writing. I care about turning the complex into the simple, and creating the kind of user experience that users don't even have to think twice about.

Put plainly: I'm a powerhouse Content Designer, coming from a strong background in technical writing. 

I've been perfecting my writing skills for years, learning how to keep the user at the center of all that I do.

I've worked as a lone writer and in teams as small as nine writers to a team of almost 70. 

I can navigate Figma, Git, JIRA, the Adobe Creative Suite, analytics tools like Google Analytics and Pendo, and more. It's easy to dive into code, and I have experience with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. I know the basics of programming and constructing websites. I know how to create impactful instructional videos, and killer technical documentation in Markdown, AsciiDoc, and multiple out-of-the-box CMSs. I love a good style guide and playing around with Vale to ensure automated writer compliance. I even have a great of understanding of how Agile is supposed to work. 

In less than a year, I was promoted to Content Design Lead at Couchbase. I've implemented style guides for our documentation, UX copy, and our new Pendo content. I've written UI copy for several of our new features, jumping in with the UX designers to craft better and better user experiences - resulting in positive user feedback and happier stakeholders during feature review sessions. I'm helping to overhaul the entire information and content architecture of our documentation website, focusing on the user experience. 

I firmly believe that I can help change the way users interact with and experience products through each word they encounter along the way - whether they notice it or not! 

I initially started this website as a coding demonstration, for showing off the web development skills I learned from some basic HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS courses. It's grown over time as I've learned more and figured out how to customize and elevate what I had. Currently, this website is based off of a Jekyll theme and is the home for my writing samples, photography, and contact information.
