One of my first major tasks at Couchbase was creating a style guide, to try and get the 10+ person writing team working with greater consistency. 

The first iteration of the style guide was posted on my work GitHub account.
I created the theme based on the default Antora site theme, adding in some Couchbase styling and elements from the main documentation site. 

You can find that initial version of the style guide at [https://sarahlwelton.github.io/cb-vale-style-guide/styleguide/index.html](https://sarahlwelton.github.io/cb-vale-style-guide/styleguide/index.html). 

After some management changeover and a little more of a serious talk about the importance of the style guide, we incorporated the style guide into our contributor's guide on the main documentation website: [https://docs.couchbase.com/styleguide/index.html](https://docs.couchbase.com/styleguide/index.html).

There are 2 other style guides that I tried to create to guide efforts when the documentation team's mandate was larger, and included Pendo and UI copy. You can still view those on the site. 

## Vale Style Guide

The Couchbase Style Guide also has a [Vale](https://vale.sh) implementation, which you can see here: [https://github.com/couchbaselabs/docs-style-guide](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/docs-style-guide).

I figured out all of the configuration, and have written most of the Vale rules myself, to catch common issues that contradict the style guidance from the style guide, or just common mistakes.

<!-- ## UI and UX Style Guide 

As time went on, I realized that we also hadn't created any guidance or consistency for creating UI copy or other UI elements. After doing a thorough review of the UI copy in the Couchbase Capella product, a coworker and I decided that we needed to record our decisions somehow. 

So, I spun up another style guide to reflect the best practices I'd learned about UI copy, and to start recording some of our decisions about how to write in the UI: [https://sarahlwelton.github.io/cb-vale-style-guide/ui-ux/index.html](https://sarahlwelton.github.io/cb-vale-style-guide/ui-ux/index.html).

## Pendo Style Guide 

Next, my manager decided that we were going to introduce and roll out Pendo in Capella. The project fell largely on my shoulders, and I found myself needing to hammer out all of the process for Pendo - including how we were going to write its in-app guides. 

To ensure consistency, this required a great amount of detail, down to the individual settings for each guide type: [https://sarahlwelton.github.io/cb-vale-style-guide/pendo/index.html](https://sarahlwelton.github.io/cb-vale-style-guide/pendo/index.html).
