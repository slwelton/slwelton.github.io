During my time at Couchbase, I ended up creating 3 style guides. They all live together on the same website, but I'll break them down in detail, here.

I created the theme based on the default Antora site theme, adding in some Couchbase styling and elements from the main documentation site. 

## Technical Documentation Style Guide

When I first arrived, the documentation team didn't have a style guide. I decided that my first mandate was to create their first technical documentation style guide, which can be found at [https://sarahlwelton.github.io/cb-vale-style-guide/styleguide/index.html](https://sarahlwelton.github.io/cb-vale-style-guide/styleguide/index.html).

The style guide also has a Vale implementation, which can be found at [the following GitHub repository](https://github.com/sarahlwelton/cb-vale-style-guide/tree/main/ValeStyles).

## UI and UX Style Guide 

As time went on, I realized that we also hadn't created any guidance or consistency for creating UI copy or other UI elements. After doing a thorough review of the UI copy in the Couchbase Capella product, a coworker and I decided that we needed to record our decisions somehow. 

So, I spun up another style guide to reflect the best practices I'd learned about UI copy, and to start recording some of our decisions about how to write in the UI: [https://sarahlwelton.github.io/cb-vale-style-guide/ui-ux/index.html](https://sarahlwelton.github.io/cb-vale-style-guide/ui-ux/index.html).

## Pendo Style Guide 

Next, my manager decided that we were going to introduce and roll out Pendo in Capella. The project fell largely on my shoulders, and I found myself needing to hammer out all of the process for Pendo - including how we were going to write its in-app guides. 

To ensure consistency, this required a great amount of detail, down to the individual settings for each guide type: [https://sarahlwelton.github.io/cb-vale-style-guide/pendo/index.html](https://sarahlwelton.github.io/cb-vale-style-guide/pendo/index.html).
