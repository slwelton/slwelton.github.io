			<h2>New Workterm!</h2>
			<h3>January 14th, 2017</h3>
			<p>Oh boy, the new job search opens up tomorrow. This is definitely going to be interesting. I'm excited to see how my search goes this time, and what kind of opportunities become available. It's going to be 8 straight months of co-op this time, so I want to find somewhere that I will be happy and that will give me a good experience for that entire time period.</p>
			<p>It would also be awesome to come out of this last, extended co-op term with a guaranteed job coming out of graduation! Given that I'm now so close to being done my degree, it's definitely something to think about, and I'm excited for what the future might hold.</p>
			<p>But first, I have to get through another round of WaterlooWorks!</p> 
			<h2>Almost Done at OpenText</h2>
			<h3>December 13th, 2017</h3>
			<p>It's been an interesting couple of months here at OpenText. It has been over four months at this point, but it honestly doesn't feel that way, for some reason.</p>
			<p>The start of my job here definitely was not what I was hoping for: my manager being on vacation for my entire first week, and no one else who was actually in the office with me knowing what it was that I was supposed to be doing, exactly. My manager was out in the Ottawa office, which only made things more difficult. Compared to my last co-op, I can't exactly say that the onboarding was smooth!</p>
			<p>I read almost the entire user documentation manual for the Content Management System here, and in the end, I only got a couple hours of experience working in the actual system. Disappointing, but I still did manage to do some good work during my time here. Like, this entire video on how to create a voiceover in Audacity, for example:</p>
			<p>Or how to accomplish other small tasks in Camtasia:</p>
			<p>Not much in the way of technical writing accomplished this semester, but I learned a lot about teaching and sharing information with others, with how many versions of my storyboard for the Audacity script I had to go through. With video apparently becoming a pretty big deal at a lot of different companies now in the technical writing department, I think it's an important skill to maintain. I just still wish that I did have the chance to do more writing, as well, since I do have the experience, and that is what I was hoping to get out of this work term.</p>
