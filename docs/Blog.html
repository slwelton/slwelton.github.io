			<h3>December 13th, 2017</h3>
			<p>It's been an interesting couple of months here at OpenText. It has been over four months at this point, but it honestly doesn't feel that way, for some reason.</p>
			<p>The start of my job here definitely was not what I was hoping for: my manager being on vacation for my entire first week, and no one else who was actually in the office with me knowing what it was that I was supposed to be doing, exactly. That's before the fact that she was out in Ottawa in the first place, with me being in the KW office. Then, when she got back to work, I had to wait for her to get caught up before she could even attempt to deal with me. There was a lot of reading about stuff that in the end, really didn't matter in the first place.</p>
			<p>I read almost the entire user documentation manual for the Content Management System here, and in the end, I only got a couple hours of experience working in the actual system. Disappointing, but I still did manage to do some good work during my time here. Like, this entire video on how to create a voiceover in Audacity, for example:</p>
			<p>Or how to accomplish other small tasks in Camtasia:</p>
			<p>Not much in the way of technical writing accomplished this semester, but I learned a lot about teaching and sharing information with others, with how many versions of my storyboard for the Audacity script I had to go through. With video apparently becoming a pretty big deal at a lot of different companies now in the technical writing department, I think it's an important skill to maintain. I just still wish that I did have the chance to do more writing, as well.</p>
