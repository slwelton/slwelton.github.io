				<h2 class="Title">Over a year later...</h2>
				<h3 class="Subtitle">February 21st, 2019</h3>
				<p>What a ride it has been, almost a year later.</p>
				<p>After everything with interviews, I ended up working at Dematic in Waterloo. It was a neat place to work - I learned some interesting new skills related to instructional design with the course they had me working on for the entire second half of my 8-months there. I enjoyed working on my own project, the deep-dive into their help files to try and resolve the issues, a lot more - but it is what it is. It was good exposure to something new and different and something that I can take with me going forward - I now know how to properly design a course and an exam, to teach people how to do things! How about that.</p>
				<p>I thought I might have ended up working as a technical writing co-op with Google (what I was referring to with that keeping open to relocation thing in my last post), but things unfortunately just didn't work out in terms of timing. It is what it is.</p>
				<p>Now, the focus is on full-time jobs. Several resumes sent out with positive responses so far. I'm looking forward to seeing how it all works out in the end, once I've finished up my final school term. Crazy to believe that I did finally make it here, but I did it!</p>
				<p>Time to keep pushing onwards and upwards.</p>

				<h2 class="Title">Interview Time</h2>
				<h3 class="Subtitle">February 2nd, 2018</h3>
				<p>Only three jobs that I applied to for this go-round using WaterlooWorks. A commute to Toronto did not sound appealing, so my choices in technical writing were somewhat limited as a result. But at the same time, I kept myself open to relocation! And man oh man am I excited about the opportunities that I have so far.</p>
				<p>I've got two interviews coming up within the next couple of weeks. I'm really excited to see how they turn out, and just where I'll end up for my next workterm. It's going to be the start of 8 months of co-op work, so I want to have something good to look forward to.</p>
				<p>In the meantime, I'm just trying to stay on top of schoolwork, and keep trying to add new things to this website. For now, that includes a proper title banner! And that feels like a pretty great accomplishment for right now.</p>
				<p>Next, I think I'd like to add some more styling to this blog page, to make it a little more visually interesting. But that's something to consider later.</p>
				<p>On another note, HackerNestKW also had the great privilege of putting together a successful Fishackathon just a couple weeks ago. Our winner will be going on to compete against the winners from the rest of the world-wide competition. It was a great feeling to pull the entire thing together, after being so anxious about it working out in the first place! But, in the end, we succeeded, and even managed do our usual tech social on the Monday after - talk about a long weekend.</p>

				<h2 class="Title">New Workterm!</h2>
				<h3 class="Subtitle">January 14th, 2018</h3>
				<p>Oh boy, the new job search opens up tomorrow. This is definitely going to be interesting. I'm excited to see how my search goes this time, and what kind of opportunities become available. It's going to be 8 straight months of co-op this time, so I want to find somewhere that I will be happy and that will give me a good experience for that entire time period.</p>
				<p>It would also be awesome to come out of this last, extended co-op term with a guaranteed job coming out of graduation! Given that I'm now so close to being done my degree, it's definitely something to think about, and I'm excited for what the future might hold.</p>
				<p>But first, I have to get through another round of WaterlooWorks!</p>

				<h2 class="Title">Almost Done at OpenText</h2>
				<h3 class="Subtitle">December 13th, 2017</h3>
				<p>It's been an interesting couple of months here at OpenText. It has been over four months at this point, but it honestly doesn't feel that way, for some reason.</p>
				<p>The start of my job here definitely was not what I was hoping for: my manager being on vacation for my entire first week, and no one else who was actually in the office with me knowing what it was that I was supposed to be doing, exactly. My manager was out in the Ottawa office, which only made things more difficult. Compared to my last co-op, I can't exactly say that the onboarding was smooth!</p>
				<p>I read almost the entire user documentation manual for the Content Management System here, and in the end, I only got a couple hours of experience working in the actual system. Disappointing, but I still did manage to do some good work during my time here. Like, this video on how to create a voiceover in Audacity, for example:</p>
				<video controls="controls" width="640" height="360">
				<source src="Video/1. Record Your Audio in Audacity.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
				Your browser does not support the video format available.
			</video>
			<p> I'm only posting a short snippet here for space reasons (the full video is 11 minutes long!), but you can see the rest of the snippets on <a class="link" href="My Work">My Work</a>.
				<p>I also did some other videos on how to accomplish other small tasks in Camtasia:</p>
				<video controls="controls" width="640" height="360">
				<source src="Video/Exporting a Selection in Camtasia.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
				Your browser does not support the video format available.
			</video>
				<p>Not much in the way of technical writing accomplished this semester, but I learned a lot about teaching and sharing information with others, with how many versions of my storyboard for the Audacity script I had to go through. With video apparently becoming a pretty big deal at a lot of different companies now in the technical writing department, I think it's an important skill to maintain. I just still wish that I did have the chance to do more writing, as well, since I do have the experience, and that is what I was hoping to get out of this work term.</p>
