Just finished with my first co-op term at SAP. I learned so much that it's kind of sad to have to say goodbye... Claudia and Aaron were such a huge help and so supportive as managers throughout all of the last four months, and there was such a good group of co-ops. It was great to see everyone always getting along, and making an effort to be involved in the activities that the social committee kept putting together.

I know I was really happy to be a part of the committee, and organize so many of the fun holiday candygrams, escape room nights, and board game cafe outings that went on throughout the semester.

But then there was the work! I got exposed to so much in such a short amount of time, and tried to pick up on as much as I possibly could at every opportunity.

In general, I'm thrilled that I finally got some exposure to technical writing after a rough go with WaterlooWorks in the first round. The experience and things I got a chance to work on this time around were so worthwhile.

# Blogs #
First of all, there were the blog posts that I had to help out with writing. While they were more technical than what usually came to mind for me when thinking of the word "blog," it was still a great look at another side of technical writing.

I got to complete two blog posts during my co-op term:

[Whatâ€™s New in Smart Data Streaming 2.0 SP 01: Machine Learning](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/04/18/whats-new-in-smart-data-streaming-2.0-sp-01-machine-learning/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BrKGx6zBAS8WgL3xUCInjXw%3D%3D)

[Using Custom Adapters in a Streaming Project: Files and Directories](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/04/20/using-custom-adapters-in-a-streaming-project-files-and-directories/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BrKGx6zBAS8WgL3xUCInjXw%3D%3D)

I wasn't there quite long enough to make getting set up in SAP's blogging system worth it, so my work had to get published under Lena's name, but it's still more work that I can show for the future.

# Videos #
Then there were the videos. Again, I got to complete 2 different ones during my term:

I wasn't expecting technical writing to also involve making videos and blogs, but I guess we'll see how this comes in handy for the future. I'm also really glad I already had exposure to video editing in high school, though recording voiceovers was a whole new experience... Lena was a very tough but fair teacher when it came to that.

All in all, a lot of learning came out of this co-op, and I'm excited to start applying that to other things in the future.
