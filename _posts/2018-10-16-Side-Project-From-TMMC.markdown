So my mom reached out to me a little while ago - apparently, the office at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada is switching over to Windows 10, and there's some concerns as to whether or not people are going to handle the change well. For those that aren't the most computer-minded, even the slightest change can be pretty intimidating... And that's not exactly being helped by the lack of any kind of guides or preparation that's being provided to the office workers.

So that's where I came in!

The TMMC technology department did attempt to provide a "Start Guide" of sorts for Windows 10, but my mom wasn't exactly impressed. Cue me being called in to help, and to create a better version of the document... Which might actually be useful for their users.

I got rewarded with a gas card for my efforts, and knowing that the people in the office now have something they can use to help make the transition over from Windows 7 that much easier. All it took was some screenshots, some writing, and putting everything together the best I could in Publisher when I had some time available outside of my co-op.

Now, to wait and see if there's any kind of feedback, or if this is something that's useful to them.
