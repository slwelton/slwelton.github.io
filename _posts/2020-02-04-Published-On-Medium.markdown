I can't believe that I'm writing this right now, but I just got published on Medium, in the rather well-known publication [P.S. I Love You](https://psiloveyou.xyz/)!

I decided to write an article on a bit of a whim and submit to them, with knowing that open submissions for writers were opening up soon - and lo and behold, I made it!

I'm very happy to be sharing my writing through the Medium platform, and I'm looking forward to seeing how well the piece does, as well as any future pieces I may be submitting to P.S I Love You, now that I've been accepted as a writer.

If you want to read the piece for yourself, you can check it out [here](https://psiloveyou.xyz/how-i-escaped-the-vicious-cycle-of-the-dating-app-dating-game-753be218b3b1).

I personally am quite proud of this bit of writing - I'm excited to see where else it might take me.

Feel free to leave a response on Medium if you like it, too, or leave a comment below.
