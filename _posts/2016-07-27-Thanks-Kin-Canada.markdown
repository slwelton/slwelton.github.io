So, it took a while to get here, but I managed to do it. I got through my first unofficial co-op term, without having to deal with the insane stress of being unemployed.

I was so panicked when things with WaterlooWorks went sideways, but I am so so so thankful that the Public Relations coordinator at Kin Canada decided to take a chance on me, and give me a job with helping her out with PR activities for the release of the educational documentary that the organization was working on.

I hadn't really heard of Kin Canada before; I'd driven by their building enough times on the highway, but I had no idea what they were about or what they did.

Turns out, they're a service club organization, and they're pretty popular in smaller towns and communities across Canada. They were a huge deal back in WWII, and were responsible for sending tons of milk to the children in need over in Britain, who were struggling to get proper nutrition after the German bombings.

Not only did I get to learn a lot about Public Relations and social media, but I also got the chance to learn about a really cool part of Canada's history by landing this job. I don't know of many people who actually knew about this huge campaign and everything that was involved - it's definitely not something that you hear about in school.

But it'd be nice to see that change with this documentary and all of its supplementary materials becoming available.

Here's some links to the materials I created for the Kin Canada Milk for Britain documentary launch:

[Media Backgrounder - The Milk for Britain Campaign](http://www.kincanada.ca/files/www/Milk_for_Britain/Milk_for_Britain_-_Media_Backgrounder.pdf)

[Club Promotion Opportunities Sheet, News Release Template, and News Release Tip Sheet for Members](http://www.kincanada.ca/resource-library?parent_id=655)

Again, I'm so glad that I got the chance to be involved in this project, and get the opportunity to learn and fund my education at the same time.

I'm hoping that the experience I gained here will help a ton moving forward into the next round of WaterlooWorks! For now, there's another school term to get through.
