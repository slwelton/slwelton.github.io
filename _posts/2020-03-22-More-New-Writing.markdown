Another day enjoying quarantine, another chance to write.

I dove a little more into the personal side again this time around. I started poking around on this new site I found through an ad on Instagram, called [Vocal](https://vocal.media/), and was inspired by the specific collection that they have on the #metoo movement.

So, I figured, why not add my voice and my story? Maybe it will prove helpful to someone, and maybe something will come out of it. Maybe it won't really accomplish much, but at the end of the day, I'm just trying to do more to get my writing out there, and use all of what I have available to me.

The story has already been approved and published, so feel free to check it out [here](https://vocal.media/stories/a-survivor-s-timeline-of-sexual-assault).

If you enjoy it at all, please feel free to share the article directly, or leave a comment here or on Vocal.
