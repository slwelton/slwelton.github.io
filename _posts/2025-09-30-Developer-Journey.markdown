As I started this year, I decided that it was about time that I start improving my programming skills and knowledge. 

I'd made some attempts in the past with the basics - I did a C programming course during my time at the University of Windsor, another basic programming course at University of Waterloo, some basic web programming courses through sites like Udemy, and multiple attempts at Codecademy's different offerings. 

I felt like I had the basics down, but really wanted to take it further and try and develop a deeper understanding of what I was doing (and documenting!) for users. 

Enter: [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). 

I am so glad that I found this course, and that it's stuck as well as it has for me. I've been trying to devote my Fridays at work to regularly progressing through the course material. 

And it finally feels like so many of the programming concepts I kept reading about are finally starting to stick. Building full (albeit small) apps using developer-focused tools, solving specific problems... Everything has finally started to make sense. 

The code I'm reading to document translates into logic easier. The code I write to maintain this website makes more sense - I can do more with it, such as customizing the order of posts on my portfolio. I've written my own APIs and programmed basic frontends to use them, by doing the coursework. 

I'm so excited to be expanding these skills. I can't wait to actually finish working through the course and keep putting these new skills to work.
