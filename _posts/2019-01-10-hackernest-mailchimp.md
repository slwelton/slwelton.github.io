Oh happy day.

I finally got the kinks worked out with MailChimp support, and HackerNestKW FINALLY has an updated newsletter format.

No more just typing up plaintext emails in Gmail, and sending off a wall of text to everyone who's a Meetup member of HackerNestKW.

Now, I can add all kinds of formatting and design elements to make everything SO MUCH easier to read. This is so exciting!

I'm not sure if any of the other members of the HackerNest team are as excited as I am, but I count this as a big win. I can't wait to keep playing around and make the newsletter better, since I've been doing it for so long at this point.

Please check it out, and subscribe if you're interested in HackerNestKW, or other events going on each month in the KW tech community!
